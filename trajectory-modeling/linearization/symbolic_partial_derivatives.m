% Create an expression for a particular state derivative in terms of
% scalars and state variables (x1 to x13, u1, u2)

% Compute diff(x1dot, x1) for the partial derivative of x1dot with respect
% to x1. Will need to do this for every state derivative, with respect to
% every state variable and control input

%Form A and B matrices based off of these values
