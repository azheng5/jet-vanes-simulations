State estimation submodule for sensor modeling. Sensor models take the form of a single function representing a generalized sensor entity, that are do not get constrained with any particular estimator. Sensor models should be called in a loop. They are continuously fed in true trajectory inputs and a sensor config struct simulating the biases, inaccuracies, and internal conversions within the sensor. They continuously output fake sensor readings.
